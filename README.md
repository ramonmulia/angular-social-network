# angular social network

### Let's rock - Social Network
I created a social Network to rockstars! Its a simple one you can see all your rockstars friends, the feeds of them and you can also send your status too.

All data is fake! I'm using [Mock Api](www.mockapi.io) to get the datas and simulate a post.

### Endpoints
```sh
Feed GET: /api/v1/feeds
Feed POST: /api/v1/feeds
Friends GET: /api/v1/friends
```
This project was built using [Angular 6](https://angular.io/) and [Material Angular](material.angular.io) Frameworks
I created the whole project's structure using [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)

### Installation

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8.11.0 to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.
